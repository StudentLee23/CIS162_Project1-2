    <h1>Lee Chuor</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Lee.  I am currently a student in Cerritos College working in
        completing my Cloud Computing courses.  I am a working father of five kids;
        four of which are boys and one girl.  I am currently a licensed contractor
        looking to make a transition back into the tech world.  I would like to make
        the transition so that I can find a remote job, in hope that it can lead to a
        job where I can travel and work anywhere besides staying in California.  
    </p>

    <h2>On my free time, I like to:</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Take my wife and kids out to try new food or activities.</li>
    <li>Hang around with my friends.</li>
    <li>Teach myself new things</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> because
        I can entertain myself as well as teach myself something new.
